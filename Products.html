              <p class="card-text">"Food intended for pet birds" refers to specialized nutrition designed to meet the dietary requirements of various avian species kept as pets. This category of bird food encompasses a wide range of options, each tailored to the unique needs and preferences of different bird species, including parrots, canaries, finches, and budgerigars, among others.

                Pet bird food typically comes in several forms, including pellets, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and even specialized treats. These options are carefully formulated to provide essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, proteins, and carbohydrates that are vital for the health and well-being of pet birds.
                
                Seeds are a common component of many bird diets, but it's essential to offer a balanced mix to prevent dietary deficiencies. Pelleted bird food, on the other hand, provides a more complete and uniform diet, reducing the risk of selective eating and malnutrition.
                
                Fruits and vegetables play a crucial role in enhancing the nutritional diversity of a pet bird's diet, offering vitamins and fiber. Additionally, providing clean, fresh water is essential to keep birds hydrated.
                
                To ensure the optimal health of pet birds, it's crucial for bird owners to research the specific dietary needs of their feathered friends and consult with avian veterinarians or experts in aviculture. Tailoring the diet to the bird's species, age, and individual preferences will contribute to a long, happy, and healthy life for these cherished companions.</p>
